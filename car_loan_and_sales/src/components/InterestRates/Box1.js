          The used car loan interest rates are dependent on various factors
          including cost of funds, customer credentials, geography, asset,
          tenor, and discounts offered in the market. Besides that, your credit
          profile, monthly income, and repayment capacity also play a pivotal
          role. CLS ensures that you get a transparent and good deal at the time
          of availing of low-interest-rate used car loans. Our second-hand car
